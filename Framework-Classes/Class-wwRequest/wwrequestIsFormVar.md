Checks to see if a form variable exists in the request POST buffer. This method returns .T. if the key exists even if the value is blank. It will only return .F. if the key doesn't exist at all. If you need to check for blank you can simply read the key with [wwRequest::Form()](vfps://Topic/wwRequest%3A%3AForm).
