Sets a form variable to the specified value from the existing POST data block. 

This method is useful for operations where the program needs to make changes to existing POST variable provided by the client application. An example might be stripping out a password the user passed before redisplaying a DHTML form that contains this data. After the display operation is complete the original value can be reset.
