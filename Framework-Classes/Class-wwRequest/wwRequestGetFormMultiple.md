This method retrieves multiselect HTML form variables from the CGI content file into an array. Multiselect variables can be returned when using scrolling HTML lists with the SELECT MULTIPE option or multiple radio buttons and checkboxes using the same variable name.

Multi-select values can come from Multi-select lists and drop downs or from radio buttons.
