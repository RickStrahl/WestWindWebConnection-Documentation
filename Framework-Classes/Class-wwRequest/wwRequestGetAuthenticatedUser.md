Returns the name of a user if he has been authenticated by the Web server. This variable gets set and stays set once a user has entered a valid username into the browser dialog box when prompted. The username is valid for a given Web server path and down and once set cannot be unset until the browser is shut down or another authentication request is made for the same user.

This method can check both Basic and Windows Auth values either seperately or combined.
