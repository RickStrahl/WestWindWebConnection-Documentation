This method provides a high level HTML header generation routine. By default it creates the following:
<ul>
* HTTP Header
* <HEAD> section with a <TITLE> tag
* <HTML><BODY> tags
* HTML text in a large font of the header text
</ul>
The method is configurable so that you can pass custom HTTP headers, leave out the HTML heading and a few other options.
