This method is used to perform a request for Web server Basic Authentication to occur. When this method is called the browser login dialog box is popped up for the user to type in a username and password. The password is then validated by the Web server typically against the NT (or Windows) user database. The exact validation varies by Web server - IIS uses the NT User database on the server.
