This class is used to configure the Web Connection application and holds the main server's configuration settings which are read and written to the startup INI file.

This class uses Save() and Load() methods of the [wwConfig class](vfps://Topic/_S8103HQW9) to load the Server's INI file settings. You can use the Reload method to automatically cause COM Server instances to reload and re-read these settings.
