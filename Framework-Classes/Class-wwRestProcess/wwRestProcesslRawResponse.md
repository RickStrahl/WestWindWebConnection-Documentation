Determines whether the current requests returns a raw response result rather than a JSON response. 

If `.T.` the result from the method **is not converted to JSON**. Instead you are expected to use the `Response` object to create your HTTP output directly into the Response stream.

Please see [Sending raw, non-JSON Response results with a REST method](VFPS://Topic/_6VT0N947N) for more information.
