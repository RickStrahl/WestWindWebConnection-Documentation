Optional path to where DBF system files are located. Refers to wwSession and wwRequestLog.

By default this path is blank, so files are found in the current directory or along the FoxPro path. 

Use this value if you're using a shared server and you want your system files to be loaded from a location other than the current folder. 

Provide fully qualified path with drive, or a relative path relative to the application.
