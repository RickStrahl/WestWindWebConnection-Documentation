Determines whether requests are in DebugMode or 'live' mode. In Debug mode errors stop on the error in the IDE - in live mode error handlers kick in on errors.

Use DebugMode only while debugging in the IDE of if troubleshooting a live server and you want to see the error dialog from the error caused.
