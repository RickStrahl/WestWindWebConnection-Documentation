Creates an anti-forgery token that prevents cross site scripting attacks. 

To use embed the code generated by this method into the page like this:

```html
<%= Process.AddAntiForgeryToken(.T.) %>
```

which creates a **hidden form field with a validation token**. When the form is submitted it also adds a **cookie** with the token.

In your code when accepting a **POST** you can then check the validation token with which compares the post value against the cookie and timeout:

```foxpro
IF (Request.IsPostback() AND !Process.CheckValidationToken(900))
    this.ErrorDisplay.ShowError("Invalid Request.")
    RETURN
ENDIF

* ... go on processing your submit logic
```

The number provided is a timeout in seconds and determines how long this validation token is valid for - in this case 15 minutes.
