Object reference to a ready to use [wwRequest](vfps://Topic/Class%20wwRequest) object, which is used for all inputs of your application. This object is preset by the Init method of this class. When Process or your custom methods get control the oRequest object is already set.

The default Process method also exposes this object as a PRIVATE variable *Request*.
