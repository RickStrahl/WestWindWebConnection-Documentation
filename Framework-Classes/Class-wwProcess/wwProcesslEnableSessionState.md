Turns on Session Handling for this request.

This code eliminates the need to call this.InitSession explicitly and assigning it to the Session object instance. This eliminates the need to call InitSession() in the right place - with this property you can simply set the value anywhere and it just works eliminating the need to understand how the Session object works beyond getting and setting values.
