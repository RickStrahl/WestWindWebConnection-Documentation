When updating Web Connection there are a few things that you need to do in order to ensure the update goes smoothly. 

## Install the Appropriate Web Connection Version
Web Connection is distributed **in three very distinct distributions that need to be handled and installed independently**:

* **Shareware version**  
Installs using the [freely downloadable version from the West Wind Web site](https://webconnection.west-wind.com/download.aspx).

* **Licensed Developer version**  
Requires a Web Connection developer license and installs from a **private download link**. The download link is emailed to you upon registration and in update notifications, or available from your [West Wind Web Store Account](https://store.west-wind.com/profile). 

* **Deploying to a Live Server**  
Finally if you need to [deploy a Web Connection Application](dm-topic://_0j40wjbwg) you're not installing Web Connection per se, but you are publishing your finished and compiled application to a live server.

Once you have the appropriate version installed you can update to a new version. 

## Full Reinstalls are Best
Unless you are updating a version older than v6, it's best to do a **clean re-install** of Web Connection for each update to ensure that all component pieces are updated completely. 

Version 6.0 and later don't store any updated content in the installation folder, so you can safely delete and reinstall new versions for upgrades. Upgrading from older versions that stored application files in the installation folder require migration to the new project and folder structure.
