Web Connection is licensed per developer and/or per physical or virtual Windows Server instance.

Licenses can be applied interchangeably using:

* Physical/Virtual Server Runtime Licenses
* Developer Licenses

A Web Connection Developer License is required for working with Web Connection during development. **At least one development license is required** before any runtime or add-on developer licenses can be applied.

Runtime licenses can be applied **either to physical/virtual servers *OR* additional developers**.

A runtime license used as a server license can be used **per physical or virtual Windows Instance**, but you can **run many Web sites or domains on a single physical or virtual server**. 

A runtime license used for a developer allows **exactly one developer per license** to use Web Connection. You can mix and match sites or developers with your license counts (ie. 3 sites + 2 developers = 5 Runtime licenses).

For additional Server Runtime licenses **or** additional Developer licenses, runtime license packs can be purchased in various license count capacities.

### Full Developer Software and License
A full Web Connection Developer License ships with a **one Developer License and one Server Runtime License**, so a single developer can both build and deploy one or more applications **on a single physical or virtual Windows server**. The full developer license also comes with the source code for the FoxPro pieces of the framework required to build your application into a self-contained executable you can deploy.

For this reason, **at least one developer license is required** before runtime licenses can be applied. The single developer/server license counts towards the license counts, so it effectively counts as 2 licenses but specifically tied to 1 developer and 1 server.

### Server Runtime Licensing: Per Windows Instance
Web Connection Server Licenses are associated with a **Windows Instance** which can mean either:

* A bare metal server running Windows on hardware directly
* Virtual Machine running a virtual instance running Windows on Hyper-V, Virtual Box, Docker etc. 

> Regardless of physical or virtual instance, each Windows installation requires a separate Web Connection runtime license.

#### Multiple Sites per Windows Instance are allowed
On that physical or virtual instance, you can however run as many Web sites or Domains as you wish. As long as you stay on a single Windows instance, no additional licenses are needed. Only additional **physical or virtual** machines, whether for production, load balancing, staging or testing all require an additional license each.

### Developer Runtime Licensing
If you have multiple developers on your team, **each of the developers requires a separate Web Connection license**. You can either use a full developer license (which includes one dev and one server license), or you can use one runtime license and apply it to a developer instead of a machine. If you have multiple developers on your team each developer on the team needs either a full developer license or a license count of one of the runtime license packs.

#### More Detail on Server Runtime Licenses
Runtime licenses can be used for licensing Web Connection on a Production Server.

> ##### Each Windows Instance - virtual or physical - running Web Connection requires a license. 

Each runtime license is good for a **single physical server** or **virtual machine instance**. Essentially, Web Connection is licensed **per Windows instance**. 

You are allowed to run multiple Web Connection applications on a single Windows instance. 

So for example, you can run multiple domains that run separate Web Connection applications on a single Windows Server instance using a single license. 

However any additional physical or virtual Windows instances, including load balanced servers in a cluster or additional multiple machines used for backup or fallback recovery, require an additional Web Connection license.

A run-time license allows distribution of a compiled Web Connection application and distribution of any of the binary files included with Web Connection but server licensing applies to the distributed application. Either you or your client has to have a license for each Windows Instance the distributed application runs on.

#### Source Code Distribution requires a Developer License
No portions of the Web Connection framework may be re-distributed as source code without a full developer license. If your application distribution for clients requires that the Web Connection source code any part of it is distributed, your client will need a source code license.

Runtime applications can make use of any of the framework classes supplied by the Web Connection framework including the HTML rendering classes and support tools as long as distributed in compiled form (APP/EXE). 

> ##### Source Code Distribution: Developer License Required
> If you distribute your Web Connection application with source code that includes the Web Connection libraries, each distribution point or end user then requires a full development license. To avoid this requirement, you can ship your application as compiled EXE/APP files.

#### Runtime Licenses used for Developers
Run-time licenses can also be applied against additional developers. 

> ##### Each developer working with Web Connection requires a separate license. 

Any developer working with Web Connection to build or maintain a Web Connection application is required to have a license whether it is a standalone developer license or one of the runtime licenses.

### License Scenarios
To make it easier to understand licensing here are a few different scenarios for runtime licensing. 

As a broad rule, if you need more than 2 developers or two deployed sites, **runtime licenses offer a large discount over individual Web Connection developer licenses**. Just keep in mind that **a single Web Connection developer license is always required** for any organization in order to purchase additional Runtime Licenses.

#### Single Developer
A single developer can purchase a Web Connection developer license and use that license to develop the application on the local machine, and deploy Web applications to a single live Windows server instance. This means if you are a consultant and you need to build an application for a single customer, the single developer license is all you need.

#### Single Developer Multiple Servers
If you're a single developer with multiple deployed physical servers you need to have a single Web Connection developer license, plus additional runtime server licenses for each additional site deployed beyond the first one.

If you have 2 sites deployed your best bet is to use two full developer licenses:

* <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/product/wconnect70" target="top">2 Single Developer Licenses</a>

For more than 2 sites it's cheaper to use the 2 or 5 license pack on top of the full developer runtime:

* <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/product/wconnect70" target="top">Single Developer License</a>
* <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/product/wcrun02" target="top">2 Server Runtime License</a>
* <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/product/wcrun05" target="top">5 Server Runtime License</a>

* <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/ItemList_Abstract.aspx?Search=Web+Connection+Runtime" target="top">Runtime Server Pricing</a>

#### Multiple Developers and/or Multiple Sites
If you have multiple developers and multiple sites you'll almost certainly will want to take advantage of the runtime license discounts. A single developer license can be purchased and each developer can use a runtime license count as a developer license.

> **Note:** A single Developer License is always required

#### Distributing (vertical) Web Connection Applications
If you need to distribute a Web Connection application as a vertical application, the same per Windows instance licensing applies: Each physical server that uses the application has to have a license accounted for. Your customers either need to acquire a license on their own, or you can manage that license for your customer by purchasing the appropriately sized license to cover XX number of customer Windows instances. 

One of the licenses is also an [unlimited runtime distribution license](https://store.west-wind.com/product/wcrununlim) that allows you to distribute to as many additional clients **without specific limits on license counts**. For a development shop with a few developers or a shop that serves a number of customers this might be the most cost efficient way to build many applications with multiple developers deployed to many servers.

### Licensing Highlights
The following rules apply:

> ##### @icon-info-circle One Full Developer License Required
> Every Web Connection installation requires **at least one full developer license**. Runtime licenses can then purchased for **additional distribution or developer licenses** on top of the developer license.

> #### @icon-info-circle Every Developer needs a License
> Every Developer using Web Connection to build or debug Web Connection applications has to have a license.

> #### @icon-info-circle Every Windows Server/Client Instance needs a Runtime License
> Every Windows Instance (Server or Client, physical or Virtual Machine) that Web Connection is deployed to requires a license.

> #### @icon-info-circle Base Web Connection License includes One Development and Deploy License
> The base single developer Web Connection license includes a developer license and allows deploying to a single Windows instance for a deployed application. The developer license is essentially all a single developer needs to build and get an application online.
