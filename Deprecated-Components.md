This section holds components that are still present in one form or another in Web Connection, but that have been officially deprecated. This means that they are no longer supported, but you can continue to use them. 

Most of the deprecated components have updated components that can be used instead. 

The big exception is the Web Control Framework - still works, but we no longer support it and we won't make fixes to it.
