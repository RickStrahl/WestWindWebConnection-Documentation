There are a number of tutorials that talk about building services to perform operations for your applications. While services are a great way to go and I would recommend using them for any application that has more than a few callbacks to the server from the client side, sometimes that's just overkill if you need only to validate a simple value or retrieve a simple value.

In this section, we provide a few simple examples how you can use just jQuery and simple wwProcess methods to fire operations on the server.
