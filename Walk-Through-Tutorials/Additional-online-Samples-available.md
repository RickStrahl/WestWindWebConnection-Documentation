In addition to the walk throughs in this section, there are a few additional complete sample applications available that you can check out, install, run yourself and modify.

### Time Trakker (MVC)
This is a small, but fairly rounded time tracking application that allows creating and editing of time tickets, browsing for tickets and creating reports.

This application is a great example of an MVC style application using mostly server rendered UI along with a bunch of support client side scripting to provide support features.

### West Wind Message Board (MVC)
The West Wind Message Board application is an online forum, that we use ourselves to manage all support issues. It uses a rich user interface, markdown for message editing, includes some cool image embedding and upload features and more.
