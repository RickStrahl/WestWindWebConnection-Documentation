This class is an Aysnc Event manager that manages events placed into a table. Both client and server applications can look at this event management table to get their input, create their output and pass data between the client and server applications.

Methods exist to pass data into the even table by using special input fields or an easy to use property mechanism that can set and retrieve individual properties WITH a single command.
