Adds a certificate from a `.pfx` self-contained certificate file.

The .pfx must contain an embedded private key in order for this to work. You may be presented with a password dialog if the `.pfx` is password protected.

> If you have other certificate formats (like `.crt` files) you have to convert the certificate first.
