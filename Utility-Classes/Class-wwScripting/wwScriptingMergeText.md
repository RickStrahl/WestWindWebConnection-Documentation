﻿Provides Template parsing for expression evaluated tempaltes. Unlike script pages, MergeText evaluates pages by parsing each script block individually and executing the code contained in it. Uses EVALUATE for `<%= %>` expressions and EXECSCRIPT for `<% %>` blocks. 

Note that these pages do not execute as a single PRG file so individual Code blocks cannot see variables from other code blocks unless they are made PUBLIC. 

For expression based pages template parsing with MergeText can be significantly faster than the script functions.
