The ControlSource binds a value expression to the Text Property by default. This binds the HyperLink's display label.

Binding is one way only. Unbind() is not supported.

Expressions can be any valid Visual FoxPro expression that is in Scope including variables, class properties or even functions and class methods if you're only doing inbound binding.
