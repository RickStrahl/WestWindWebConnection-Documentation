The ControlSource binds a value expression to the Text Property by default. 

Binding is one way only on the label control - Unbinding is not supported.

Expressions can be any valid Visual FoxPro expression that is in Scope including variables, class properties or even functions and class methods if you're only doing inbound binding.
