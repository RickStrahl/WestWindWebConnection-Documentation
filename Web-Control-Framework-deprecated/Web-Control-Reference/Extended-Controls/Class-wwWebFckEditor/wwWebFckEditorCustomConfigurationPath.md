Path to a .js file that has overrides for FCK configuration settings. 

This allows you to define a custom .js file that can override any of the default FCK settings without touching the FCK distribution files. Use this option if you have a common set of overrides you need to apply and want to reuse with the control in many places.

These settings are applied by FCK before any of the control properties are assigned.

For 'inline' configuration overrides in an individual page you can also use the [ClientOnLoad](vfps://Topic/_2440VWG1Z) handler
