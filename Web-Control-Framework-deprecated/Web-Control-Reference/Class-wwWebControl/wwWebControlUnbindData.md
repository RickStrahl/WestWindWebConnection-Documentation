UnbindData retrieves data from a Control and binds it back into its ControlSource.

This powerful method makes short work of retrieving data from controls back into their data stores. DataBind() works hierarchically so you can call it on the WebPage and it will fire for all controls on the page.

ControlSource binding is available at the control level and also at container level which will Unbind all child controls.
