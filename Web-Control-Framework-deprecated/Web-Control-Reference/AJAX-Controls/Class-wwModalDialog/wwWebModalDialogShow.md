A server side method that causes the dialog to be displayed when the page is reloaded.

Effectively this server side trigger mechanism for the client side dialog, but remember that the operation of the dialog is entirely client side. This means any clicks fire on the client and the client side event handlers (if any) are activated when you click a button and no postback occurs.
