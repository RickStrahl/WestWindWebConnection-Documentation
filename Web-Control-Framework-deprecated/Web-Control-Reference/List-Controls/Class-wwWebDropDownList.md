The wwWebDropDownlist creates a standard Web dropdown list.

The list supports both DataSource binding for it's list content and ControlSource binding for the SelectedValue property by default.

Please refer to the [wwWebListControl class reference](vfps://Topic/_1MX0QL8ON) for control behavior. The only difference between the base functionality is pre-configuration for a single line (DropDown) display.
