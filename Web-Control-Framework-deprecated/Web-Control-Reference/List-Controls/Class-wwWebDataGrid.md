The wwWebDataGrid provides a cursor based, read-only 'grid' control for displaying data in columnar format.

The DataGrid can display data either based on the current database structure by auto-generating columns from the data source, or you can create custom column layouts to describe the layout. Databinding can be done via powerful FoxPro expressions that are rendered for each column and can be executed dynamically to produce sophisticated layouts and rendering.
