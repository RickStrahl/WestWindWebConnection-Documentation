Can be assigned to inside of the [RowRender event](vfps://Topic/_1P80YKL4Z) to completely override rendering of an individual row. If set the full row including the <tr></tr> tags must be rendered in the text assigned to this property. This value is cleared before every call to the RowRender event.

If this property is set with a string value all other rendering for this row does not occur.
