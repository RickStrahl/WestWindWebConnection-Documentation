Function that extracts a string from within another string based on two delimiters.  The function operates case insensitively and the string returned by default returns the value between the first set of matched delimiters.

Options allow returning the delimiters as part of the string, as well as ignoring a non-match for the end delimiter in which case the string returns the remainder of the string.
