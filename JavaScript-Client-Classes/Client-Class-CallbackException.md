The Callback Exception object is used to return errors from any callbacks. Any errors are always routed to the callbackErrorHandler specified on the client control (or parameter if available).

Most framework errors that occur as part of a callback will fire the callback handler. This includes network and security errors from XmlHttp, server side execution or routing errors, as well as possible control assignment (for Panel operations).
