Used to make an asynchronous HTTP call to the server and return the result into a callback function. This method provides error handling and any errors that occur are fired into the OnError handler.The result of the callbacks are routed to either the callback handler parameters provided in the method, or to a returned jQuery Promise object or - if both are defined - both. The success handlers receive the raw HTTP response. The errr handler receives a [CallbackException object](vfps://Topic/_1Q81D34KG)
