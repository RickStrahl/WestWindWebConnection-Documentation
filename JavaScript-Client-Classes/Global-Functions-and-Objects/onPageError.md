A generic error display routine that can display error messages from a CallbackException object (or really any object that has a .message property) that can be used for displaying errors from AJAX routines to provide the error event handler. This routine displays an error message via showStatus on a status bar with highlighting.This method can be used to provide instant error display in Callback methods and other AJAX handlers that display errors.  Provided mainly to remove the need to declare even this simple one line function in every page. To override and still use onPageError as a function name simply declare a function onPageError on your own page - your function will override the library version.
