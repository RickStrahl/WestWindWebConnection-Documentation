Extracts the contents of the `<body>` tag in from a full HTML document string. Useful when you need to load the content of the document in jQuery which cannot load a full HTML document but needs an HTML fragment instead.```foxpro$.get("somepage.html", function(html){   var body = getBodyFromHtmlDocument(html);      // create something that jquery can work with   $el = $("<div>" + body + "</div>");});```
