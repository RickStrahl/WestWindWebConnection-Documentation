This method retrieves a jQuery object by:

* Raw ID value
* Any ID that ends in `_{id}`


It's highly useful in Web Control Framework applications where you can lookup nested controls that may have a control prefix like `ctl00_MainContent_txtSymbol` where you can just use `$$("txtSymbol")` to find the element.
