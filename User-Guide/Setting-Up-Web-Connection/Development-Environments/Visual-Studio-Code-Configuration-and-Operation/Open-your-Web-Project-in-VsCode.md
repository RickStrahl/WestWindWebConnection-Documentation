In order to use VS Code you'll want to open Code in **Folder Mode** by pointing it at the Web Folder in your Web Connection Project. The easiest way to do that is by navigating to your project and the web folder then using the Explorer shortcut to **Open in VS Code**:

Alternately you can also use **File -> Open Folder...** from inside of Visual Studio code to open a folder directly.

> Remember to always open the **Web** folder in VS Code, not the root of the project.

Once the folder is opened you'll get an *File Explorer* view that shows you all files as well as Git Status and it's easy to add, delete, rename and move files around using the file view.
