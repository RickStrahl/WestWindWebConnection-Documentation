The Path where message files are written for file based messaging.

This path can either be a physical path or a path relative to the Web root folder.

Web Root Folder Syntax Example:
~\webconnection.deploy\temp\wc\

where the ~\ is expanded to the Web root's folder (ie. c:\inetpub\wwwroot\yourapp).
