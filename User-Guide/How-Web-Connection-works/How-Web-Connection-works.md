This section of the documentation explains the Web Connection architecture in detail. Although it's not required that you understand exactly how the framework works it will help you be more efficient with Web Connection and gives you the potential to change the base behavior to fit your needs. And of course, some people just have to *know*. 

```html
<%= RenderSection("scripts") %>
```

One thing that you'll find as you read through this section is that there's a lot of information here and it can sound potentially overwhelming at first. Web Connection is a very powerful tool and it has lots of ways to accomplish tasks, but you don't have to use or even understand all of them or how they work to be productive. This section drills into the architecture for those of you that want to understand how Web Connection works under the covers.
