As of Version 7.20 Web Connection has basic support for Web Sockets based on a message based architecture. Web Sockets allow you to send messages from the server to the client and receive those messages on the client in JavaScript or any Web Socket client, which can also be desktop applications (but not natively in FoxPro - it requires .NET or some other library).

You can check out the Web Socket Chat sample here:
