The server form provides visual input to your operational server. This form is optional, but serves a functional role in providing visual feedback on your operating server.

The main part of the form is made up of the process display which shows the current request running and the time that it took to run it. 

The Status button on this form takes you to the [Server Status form](vfps://Topic/The%20server%20status%20form) that shows the server's current operational parameters and allows you to adjust these settings and save them for startup.
