The first step takes you through specifying a database. You can either create a new database or add the files to an existing database.

In most cases you'll want to add the tables to an existing database so you can use a single connection to access your own data as well as let Web Connection share that data connection.

There are two connection options depending on how you want to create the database:

* **Create a new Database**  
In this case you should provide the connection string to the Master database.

* **Add tables and Stored Procedures to an an existing database**  
In this case you should provide the connection string to the existing database.
