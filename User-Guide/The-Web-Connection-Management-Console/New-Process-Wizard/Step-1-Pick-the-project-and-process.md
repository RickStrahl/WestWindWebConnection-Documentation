Keeping with the WebDemo example the main program is going to be WebDemoMain.prg. This file is always going to be a Web Connection mainline file. The Process name will be the PRG file that is to be created with a skeleton class also described in the above topic.

Select your Web Server so the Management Console can create virtual directories and scriptmaps as needed.
