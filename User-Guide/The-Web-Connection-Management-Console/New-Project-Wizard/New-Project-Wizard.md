The new project Wizard allows you to create a brand new Visual FoxPro project that contains all of the required Web Connection base files and a starter main process class that handles Web requests. This process is designed so you can quickly get up to speed creating a new server application skeleton framework within minutes.

Once the Wizard completes you'll have a project and a main process class to which you can add your own code immediately. The Wizard also allows you to configure a new virtual directory as well as a scriptmap specific to your application.
